# CoVID-19 Oxygen Deprivation Quick Detection system

## Project Overview and Purpose
Build a low-cost complex system that can quickly detect if a person is having a 3rd stage of CoVID-19 disease or not by immediate measuring and using input of Oxygen level in blood of a human with their body temperature.

My system should capable of another advantages :

  • Quick reaction soft real time system that capable of returning immediately the result ( level of suspicion having a CoVID – 19 stage 3 ) base on input data ( % oxygen in blood and body temp ).

  • Home-made system where people can easily check for the blood oxygen situation when hospital and medical center is overloaded.

  • Cheap, fast and easy – to – use system with Oxygen level sensor and body temperature sensor => Everybody can create and use at home, school, street ( save money and time ).
